# Motion Graphics Skills for AI Coding Agents

> **51 open-source skills that teach your AI coding agent to make motion graphics, animation, and video** — kinetic typography, data-driven charts, explainers, TikTok / Reels, 3D & WebGL, math animation, generative illustration, and web motion. Fifteen installable packs. Install one, and your agent just knows how.

Motion is the hardest thing to get right from a prompt: timing and easing, safe areas, frame-accurate rendering, on-brand type and color, a loop that actually loops. These skills encode that craft as agent-native workflows — each one teaches the agent *how a professional would build it*, with a **deliver-and-verify loop** (render a frame → screenshot → check) so it inspects its own output instead of hoping.

They're the open-source craft behind **[iart.ai](https://iart.ai/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=motion-skills&utm_content=intro)**, the AI motion agent. Bring them into the agent you already use — or let iart.ai run the whole pipeline for you.

## The 15 packs

Each pack is its own repo, aimed at one audience. Install only what you need.

## Install

Each pack installs on its own:

```bash
npx skills add iart-ai/tiktok-video-skills
npx skills add iart-ai/data-animation-skills
# …or any pack above
```

Or add one as a Claude Code plugin:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add iart-ai/web-animation-skills
```

Once installed, skills are auto-discovered by Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and 40+ agents — and activate on their own when your prompt matches the work.

## What's a skill?

A skill is a self-contained folder (`SKILL.md` + `references/`) that teaches an agent one motion-graphics workflow — kinetic typography, beat-synced cuts, frame-accurate data charts, accessible web animation, and so on. No model fine-tuning, no plugin runtime: just the know-how, in a format every major agent already reads.

Skills that produce a visual artifact ship a **deliver-and-verify loop** plus a small `scripts/` toolkit (freeze a frame, tile a contact sheet, probe the encoded MP4), so the agent confirms its own output — web skills render a standalone HTML, video skills render via Remotion or Manim.
